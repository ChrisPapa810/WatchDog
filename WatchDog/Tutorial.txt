--To add on infinite loop to execute every X mins we use linux's 'crontab -e' more specific we add the 
line bellow:

--emailBase.py
The script that takes the message.txt file from flatFilesUtil/ and send the text through an email. It need the data.csv file that contains an email address (with credentials) to use it as source and destinations addresses. If data.csv doesn't exist then it ask from user to insert these info. At this 
point on 'crontab -e' command, it need already exist this file to works automated.
