	&& EmailSendTool.py &&
_________________________________

- (no arguments) 
It works with the classic way. 
The program search on 'flatFilesUtil/data.csv' path for the email file and on 'flatFilesUtil/message.txt' path for the message file. 
If the file with source/target emails doesn't exist the program asks from user to enter it.
If the file with the message doesn't exist the app stops working.

-(argument_1='Path for source/target emails csv file' || argument_2='Path for message txt file')
It works same with previous one, but it doesn't asks from user to write anything. If program doesn't find any file, it raise an exception.
Before do anything script check that paths for files are valid. If they don't an exception will raise
